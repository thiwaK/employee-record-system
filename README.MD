# üóÇÔ∏è Employee Record System

This repository contains the source code for an Employee Record System developed during a one-month internship at the [Natural Resources Management Center](https://doa.gov.lk/nrmc-home/) in Peradeniya, Kandy.

---
## üìñ Story
During my internship, I was tasked with updating an existing, non-functional local system and transforming it into a fully operational platform. Due to the poor implementation of the original system, most components had to be programmed from scratch. By the end of the internship, the system was fully functional and incorporated features requested by the HRM and ICT divisions.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Dashboard**: Provides an overview of the organization's structure and employee statistics.
- **Custom Right-Click Context Menu**: Includes update, edit, and delete functionality.
- **Dynamic Loading**: The entire system is dynamically configured and loaded based on the database, with no hardcoded settings.
- **Employee Management**: Add, remove, and update employee details.
- **Filtering**: Filter employee records based on various criteria.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access for Admin and Manager users.
- **Security**: Intermediate-level security measures for data protection.
- **Technology Stack**: Built with PHP, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- **Missing Functions**: Certain functionalities are not implemented yet, such as:
    - Printing filtered results.
    - Backing up the database.

- **Screen Size Restriction**: The system is optimized for desktop computer screens only. Bootstrap responsiveness has not been implemented to support smaller screen sizes or mobile devices.
- **Potential Bugs**: As the system was developed within a short time frame, there may be some unidentified bugs that could affect functionality.
