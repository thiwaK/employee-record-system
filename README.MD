# 🗂️ Employee Record System

This repository contains the source code for an Employee Record System developed during a one-month internship at the [Natural Resources Management Center](https://doa.gov.lk/nrmc-home/) in Peradeniya, Kandy.

## 📖 Story
During my internship, I was tasked with updating an existing, non-functional local system and transforming it into a fully operational platform. Due to the poor implementation of the original system, most components had to be programmed from scratch. By the end of the internship, the system was fully functional and incorporated features requested by the HRM and ICT divisions.
